## Current status

 * Under active development.
 * Don't try and use it.
 * If it breaks or eats your data, your problem.

## What

A user space filesystem that uses youtube videos as data storage.

 * [Overview PDF](docs/MBNOG1.pdf)

## Why

Random thought; Hacky proof of concept sort of worked with youtube live. This is a more polished version.

 * But really, why not? 

## How

fuse bindings -> node -> qrencode -> ffmpeg -> youtube video
